# SpTRSV_Stuff

Sparse Triangular Solver (SpTRSV) is a major bottleneck in scientific computations. The inherently sequential nature of triangular solvers forces computations to proceed step by step, resulting in significant delays. However, for SpTRSV, the sparsity pattern of the matrix can provide opportunities for parallelism, which can be exploited to accelerate the process. In this study, I proposed a hardware architecture to speed up SpTRSV computations and analyzed its performance across different input matrix types. A detailed description is available in my [report](https://github.com/dilshansk/SpTRSV_Stuff/blob/main/documents/Evaluating%20SpTRSV%20Design%20Performance%20for%20FPGAs-Report.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/dilshansk/SpTRSV_Stuff/blob/main/documents/Evaluating%20SpTRSV%20Design%20Performance%20for%20FPGAs-Presentation.pdf).
